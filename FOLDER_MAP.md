# AgroLink — Route & Folder Map (Next.js App Router)

Everything below is BUILT unless marked [scaffold].

src/app/
  layout.tsx                      Root layout — fonts + metadata (incl. metadataBase, OG/Twitter defaults,
                                   viewport/themeColor, SW registration script) only, no chrome
  not-found.tsx                   Branded 404

  sitemap.ts                      /sitemap.xml — static routes + every published product/farm project
  robots.ts                       /robots.txt — disallows /admin, /api, /account, /login

src/components/
  layout/       Header (+ search, + session-aware sign-in/account link), Footer, MobileNav, WhatsAppFab, SearchOverlay
  market/       ProductCard (renders uploaded photo, falls back to category icon), MarketGrid (client filter/search)
  farm/         FarmCard
  forms/        FormField helpers, SourcingRequestForm, SupplierSubmissionForm,
                QuoteRequestForm, ParticipationRequestForm — each posts to its API
                route and swaps to the same success copy used in the HTML prototype
  academy/      EnrollButton (client) — records interest via /api/academy-enrollments,
                then opens WhatsApp
  account/      SignOutButton (client) — used on /account
  uploads/      MediaUploader (client) — direct-to-Cloudinary image/video/document
                upload with inline previews, progress, and automatic cleanup-on-remove;
                used by AddProductModal, SupplierSubmissionForm, and PostUpdateModal
  ui/           badges.tsx — VerificationBadge, StagePill, DemoDataBadge, SectionHead
                (shared across every public page)
  admin/        AdminSidebar, AdminMobileNav, Toaster, ui.tsx, ProductsTable,
                SuppliersTable, SourcingRequestsBoard, FarmProjectCard, LeadsTable,
                CmsEditor, AddProductModal, AddFarmProjectModal, PostUpdateModal,
                CurriculumModal

src/lib/
  db.ts            Prisma client singleton
  whatsapp.ts      wa.me link builder + message templates + display number
  cloudinary.ts       Unsigned direct-to-Cloudinary upload helper (image/video/document)
  cloudinary-admin.ts Server-only signed deletion — parses public_id/resource_type
                       back out of a secure_url, scoped to the "agrolink/" folder
  roles.ts         elevateRoleIfVisitor() — the one-way VISITOR → role promotion
                    used by all four elevation trigger points (see api/ list above)
  auth.ts          NextAuth config — one instance, two providers: Credentials
                   (admin, id "admin-credentials", bypasses the Prisma adapter)
                   and Email (public magic-link, via the Prisma adapter)
  mail.ts          Sends the magic-link email via Resend's HTTP API; logs the
                   link to the console instead if RESEND_API_KEY isn't set
  og-logo.ts       The real emblem as a base64 data URI — embedded directly
                   into OG image cards so generation never depends on the
                   site being publicly reachable
  validation/      [scaffold] zod schemas shared between public forms and API routes
                   (forms currently validate server-side only, in the route handler)

public/
  logo-mark.png    Canonical transparent-background emblem — used by Header,
                   Footer, and AdminSidebar; also the source for icon-512.png
  icon-192.png / icon-512.png /
  icon-maskable-512.png            The three PWA manifest icon sizes (maskable
                                    has an opaque forest-green background,
                                    scaled into Android's safe zone)
  sw.js            Deliberately conservative service worker — offline fallback
                   + cache-first hashed build assets only, never touches
                   /api/*, /admin/*, or any dynamic page

prisma/
  schema.prisma    Full data model incl. AdminUser.passwordHash, SiteContent
  seed.ts          Seeds demo data + first admin login

Why this shape:
- `(public)` and `admin/(dashboard)` are both route groups so each can carry
  its own layout/chrome (site nav vs. dashboard sidebar) without leaking into
  the other, and so `/admin/login` can sit outside the auth gate on its own.
- Every page is a server component that fetches via Prisma directly — no
  client-side loading spinner on first paint anywhere in the app. Each page
  ships small, focused client components only for the interactive slice
  (a filter, a form, a modal, a kanban board).
- Every API route re-validates with zod (public routes) or re-checks
  `isAdminSession()` (admin routes) itself, even though the calling page
  already gates access — routes must never trust that only the intended
  page could have called them.
- `VerificationRecord` is written on every supplier status change from the
  API route itself, not the UI, so the audit trail can't be bypassed by a
  different client.
- Product/farm photography is intentionally not faked with stock images —
  cards use a category icon on a solid forest-green field until real photo
  upload (step 1 in README) is wired up.
- Role elevation only ever fires once per user (VISITOR → something else)
  and only SUPPLIER requires an admin action first — see src/lib/roles.ts
  for the full reasoning. This keeps the four trigger points (three public
  API routes + one admin route) simple one-line calls instead of a stateful
  role-transition system.
- The Cloudinary delete endpoint is intentionally not auth-gated, because
  guest forms need to be able to clean up their own removed-before-submit
  uploads too. Safety instead comes from scoping: it can only ever delete
  assets whose public_id starts with "agrolink/" — the one folder this app
  ever uploads to.
- The service worker never caches a dynamic page, `/api/*`, or `/admin/*` —
  only the static offline fallback and hashed `_next/static` build assets.
  This app's data (prices, verification status, sourcing-request stages)
  changes too often for a more aggressive caching strategy to be safe.
