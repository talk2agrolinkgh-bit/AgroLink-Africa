// src/lib/roles.ts
// Auto-elevates a signed-in user's role the first time they take an action
// that clearly signals what they're using AgroLink for. Deliberately
// simple: role only ever moves off VISITOR once, automatically. After that,
// changing someone's role is a manual admin decision — we never flip a
// SUPPLIER to BUYER just because they also submitted a sourcing request,
// and we never re-run elevation logic against a role that's already set.
//
// Triggers wired in:
//   BUYER    — submitting a sourcing request or a product inquiry
//   FARMER   — requesting participation in a Farm For You project
//   STUDENT  — expressing interest in an Academy course (enroll click)
//   SUPPLIER — deliberately NOT automatic on submission; a self-reported
//              "I'm a supplier" claim isn't worth much. It elevates only
//              when an admin actually verifies one of their listings — see
//              the PATCH handler in api/admin/suppliers/[id]/route.ts.
